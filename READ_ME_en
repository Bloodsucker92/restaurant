Do the following steps to run the app:

1) Change the database credentials in file dao/resources/beans-dao.xml;
2) Check <prop key="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto"></prop> in dao/resources/beans-dao.xml.
   For the first launch it should equal 'create' or 'create-drop'.
   Database initializing scripts are stored in file 'data.sql' which is executed on the app start up;
3) Configure the Tomcat web server. I used Tomcat 8.5.11;
4) Run the application.
